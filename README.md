## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps us to draw a picture of previously happened election in INDIA. This further helps us to decide which party is ahead in the race and in this year which party has the maximum chances to win the election.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present.
- Step 5 : Used figma for basic layout 
- Step 8 : Visual filters (Slicers) were added 
- Step 9 : Two card visuals were added to the canvas.
# Insights

A single page report was created on Power BI Desktop & it was then published to Power BI Service.

Following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard;

2014 - Bharatiya Janta Party wins with good margin.
2019 - Bharatiya Janta Party continues with their winning rally and came back in power with better margin from 2014.
- voters are also increased in numbers from 2014 - 2019.
